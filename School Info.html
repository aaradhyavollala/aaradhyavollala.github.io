Sri Chaitanya first surfaced on the academic horizon in the year 1986 and within a span of 25 years went on to become Asia's largest educational group. The past two and a half decades witnessed Sri Chaitanya introducing novel academic programmes that have helped students enter the nation's premier engineering and medical colleges. The manner in which the Group has transformed the outlook towards education has been nothing short of exemplary.
